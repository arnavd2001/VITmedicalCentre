The innovation of technologies could bring support to the quality of life for human
in various aspects and objectives. However, in order to apply and implement
technology system to be used requires the costly investment for itself.

This is a Programme that allows the Management of Hospital Queues, MRI Scans and also allows to Procure different services with the Blood Bank

This project is designed to
help the public who suffers from long queues in hospitals, especially the public
hospitals, who cannot afford expensive Softwares and are generally too crowded to cater to public in an Organised way.

The language used is C++
The Project is done under the able guidance of Dr. Y V Yarlagadda who is our Course Instructor of DSA at VIT UNIVERSITY, VELLORE.

- A Menu Driven Programme has been designed to perform different operations on the Patient Queue, as per user choice.
- Billing will be more efficient for the Patients in the Queue.
- A Multispeciality Hospital will be able to manage queues better - by directing queues to the respective departments in the hospital.
- A direct option to Donate Blood is offered to every patient on checkout. This option can be availed by the relatives of the patients accompanying the patient too. This will promote Blood Donation.
- The Blood Bank will be notified as per the update of the queue for the Patient.
